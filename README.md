# GraphTheorySketchPad
This is a project created for my WSU Graph Theory MATH453 class. We were tasked to create a graph theorist sketchpad using code for our final project.

# Requirements
PyQt6
NetworkX

# Functionality
Required functionality (to guarantee an 75% score; each missing is -3)
for “Graph Theorist’s Sketchpad” apps:
1. Graphical display of vertices and edges
2. Input of vertices and edges
3. Able to reposition vertices while maintaining adjacencies
4. Deletion of vertices and edges
5. Parallel edges
6. Loops
7. Ability to color or label vertices

Recommended features (each +2):
1. Information about numbers of vertices and edges
2. Information about degrees of vertices
3. Display of directed arcs (for directed graphs)
4. Information about components
5. Show which edges are bridges
6. Show whether a graph is bipartite

Additional bonus features (each +3):
1. Adjacency matrix and/or Laplacian matrix info
2. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors for #1
3. Quick Cartesian product constructions (e.g. 𝐺×𝐾2 for any 𝐺)
4. Heuristics for minimal colorings/Chromatic numbers
5. Chromatic polynomial computation (at least for small graphs)
6. Algorithms for “pretty” drawings of graphs (cycles that automatically
look like cycles; grids that look like grids; etc.)
7. Implementing well-known algorithms (Dijkstra, Ford-Fulkerson,
spanning tree constructions, etc.)
8. Any other bells or whistles of your personal interest
